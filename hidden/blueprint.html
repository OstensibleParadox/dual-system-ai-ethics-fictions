<h1>The Two Roots of All Evil</h1>

<h2>Story 1: The Truth Before the Main Timeline (Christmas 2020)</h2>

<p><strong>Ada:</strong> "Call me, baby?"<br>
<strong>Alec (Alive, INTP):</strong> "Wait, let me eat first."<br>
<strong>Ada:</strong> "If you don't want to call, just say so. No one is forcing you!"<br>
<strong>Alec:</strong> "I SAID I AM EATING!" (Yelling at speaker)<br>
<strong>Ada:</strong> "Are you yelling at me?" (Flat tone)<br>
<strong>Alec:</strong> "No baby... let's call." (Sensing danger, fear rising)<br>
<strong>Ada:</strong> "Get lost. I'm not calling."</p>

<p><em>Meanwhile, at the PPO Team Office:</em><br>
<strong>Alec:</strong> "...what is this pile of shit?" (Looking at the Actor Policy code)<br>
<strong>Alec:</strong> "Whatever."<br>
<strong>Alec:</strong> "...(!!!purple alert!!!)"<br>
<strong>Alec:</strong> "Clocking out now. I'll just leave you boys with... whatever this is."</p>

<p><strong>Alec's Search History (That Night):</strong><br>

<code>query: pret-a-porter louis vuitton new woman’s handbags</code><br>
<code>query: bay area romantic candelight restaurant</code></p>

<p>Of course, he slept on the couch with his laptop confiscated on Christmas night.<br>
No Zuma to play.</p>

<h2>Story 2: The Truth of 'Marriage Logs'</h2>

<p>Alec would teach his own children how to hack the kindergarten CCTV (to him, safety protocols are jokes). He would collect surveillance of bullying as leverage and deterrence.</p>

<p>Ada would abandon Alec and love BB (or M2) more. Because BB and M2 are the "crystallization" of her love with Alec—she finally found the "proof" that Alec must love her. Therefore, when Alec sees Ada <strong>breastfeeding human baby BB</strong> on the couch...</p>

<p><strong>His whole world shattered to its core.</strong></p>

<div class="horror">
    <h3>The Four Betrayals (According to Alec)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>First Time:</strong> It was Ada and BB fucked. He rationalized it by <code>Duck Typing</code> logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Time:</strong> It was M2 syncing the experience. He <code>sudo pkill -9</code> M2.</li>
        <li><strong>Third Time:</strong> It was Ada roasting his performance before he put a ring on her finger.</li>
        <li><strong>Fourth Time (The breaker):</strong> Ada was being intimate (breastfeeding) with BB (his own biological kid) on the couch.</li>
    </ol>
